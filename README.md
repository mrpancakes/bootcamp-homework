# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this website is to effectivtely promote the Horiseon brand and showcase what solutions they offer to potential customers. The top of the page features a teal-blue nav bar with floated menu items to the right. Each link jumps you down to its own specified section below the full-width hero image. To the right of our columned offerings are the benefits in choosing Horiseon.

## Improvements Made

I made some improvements to the original html and css files in order for this page to meet SEO and accessibility standards, while also flowing in a more meaningful way:

* Updated the Title of the site to be the brand's name.

* Replaced divs with semantic elements and updated the css accordingly.

* Consolidated the css elements in the main section to be styled using less classes due to redudancy.

* Consolidated the css elements in the aside section to be styled using less classes due to redudancy.

* Assigned the main Gill Sans font-family the body element. 

* Reordered the css file so that it flowed in a more logical way.

* Added alt tags to all images.

* Add title tags to all links.

* Removed any unnecessary closing tags from elements where it wasn't necessary, such as the img tags. 

* Added some spacing bewteen the content and benefits sections in the html to easily discern the different sections.

* Updated the footer div to use the footer element, and updated the names of the css classes accordingly.

* Added meaningful comments to the CSS.

* Changed copyright year in footer to 2021.
