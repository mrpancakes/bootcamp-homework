## Improvements Made

I made some improvements to the original html and css files in order for this page to meet SEO and accessibility standards, while also flowing in a more meaningful way:

* Updated the Title of the site to be the brand's name.

* Updated the opening header div to use the header element, and updated the names of the css classes accordingly.

* Added alt tags to all images.

* Add title tags to all links.

* Removed any unnecessary closing tags from elements where it wasn't necessary, such as the img tags. 

* Added some spacing bewteen the content and benefits sections in the html to easily discern the different sections.

* Update the footer div to use the footer element, and updated the names of the css classes accordingly.
